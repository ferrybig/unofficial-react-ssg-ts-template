# Unofficial React SSG TypeScript Template

This is a demo of a static site generator using React and TypeScript. It uses the `react-dom/server` package to render the React components to HTML. The output is written to the `dist` directory. This is designed for an application that has just a home page, without any routing. This is useful for some tech demo's.

## Usage

```sh
npm create unofficial-vite-react-ts-sgg folder-name
```
